# - `Startup #total_funds`
#   - Returns the total sum of investments that the startup has gotten

# - `Startup#investors`
#   - Returns a **unique** array of all the venture capitalists that have invested in this company
# - `Startup#big_investors`

#   - given a **venture capitalist object** , type of investment (as a string), and the amount invested (as a float) (args), 
# creates a new funding round and associates it with that startup and venture capitalist.

# - `Startup#num_funding_rounds`
#   - Returns the total number of funding rounds that the startup has gotten
