# Intro to SQL ðŸ›¢

(graphical)
1. Install the SQLite Browser if you haven't already [here](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
2. Open the SQLite Browser and click 'File -> Open DataBase'
3. Choose the `chinook.db` file from this repo. This database is open source and maintained by Microsoft (SQL is no fun if you don't have any data)
4. Click the tab that says 'Execute SQL'. Type SQL queries in the box above. Press the play button. See the results of that query in the box below.

(non-graphical)
5. Enter / Exit the sql prompt (SQL-land)
`$> sqlite3 mydatabase.db` / `sqlite3> .exit`

6. Get all table names / database schema (What's a schema ?)
`sqlite3> .tables` / `sqlite3> .schema`


- describes how your database is constructed 
- (what tables exist?, the columns on each table?, etc.) 

7. Execute sql files
`$> sqlite3 mydatabase.db < SQLTableTransfer`
  

## Challenges ðŸ¦¾

1. Write the SQL to return all of the rows in the artists table?

* == 'all'
SELECT <column(s)> FROM <table(s)>

```SQL
SELECT * FROM artists;
```

2. Write the SQL to select the artist with the name "Black Sabbath".

```SQL
SELECT * FROM artists 
WHERE name == "Black Sabbath";
```

3. Write the SQL to create a table named 'fans' with an autoincrementing ID that's a primary key and a name field (column) of (data-)type text

```sql
CREATE TABLE fans(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENTING,
  name TEXT
);
```

4. Write the SQL to alter the fans table to have a artist_id column type integer?

```sql
ALTER TABLE fans,
ADD artist_id INTEGER;
```

5. Write the SQL to add (insert into) yourself as a fan of the Black Eyed Peas?

```sql
INSERT INTO fans(name, artist_id)
VALUES ("Joseph", 169);
```

6. How would you update your name in the fans table to "Baby Yoda"?

```sql
UPDATE fans WHERE name = "Joseph"
SET name = "Baby Yoda";
```

7. How do you delete a record from a table in the database?

```sql
DELETE FROM fans 
WHERE name == "Joseph";
```

8. Write the SQL to return fans that are not fans of the black eyed peas.

```sql
SELECT * FROM fans 
WHERE artist_id != 169;
```

9. Write the SQL to display an artists name next to their album title.

```sql
SELECT artists.name, albums.title FROM artists
JOIN albums ON artists.id == albums.artist_id;
```

10. Write the SQL to display artist name, album title and number of tracks on that album

tables: artists, albums, tracks

```sql
SELECT artists.name, albums.title, COUNT(*) AS tracks FROM artists
JOIN albums ON albums.artist_id == artists.id
JOIN tracks ON tracks.album_id == albums.id
GROUP BY albums.title;
```
